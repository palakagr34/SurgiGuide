        "Procedure Type": "Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Shunt Procedures",
        "Procedure Name": "Creation of Shunt from brain to blood vessels",
        "Surgeon's Action": "The procedure will be about an hour long. The surgeon creates a small tube, called a shunt, that connects the brain to blood vessels in the neck or heart to drain excess fluid. This procedure is done to treat conditions like hydrocephalus, where fluid builds up in the brain and causes swelling. The surgeon may use a tiny camera, called an endoscope, to help guide the procedure.",
        "Pre-surgery Facts": "Make sure to inform your healthcare providers about all the medications and supplements you're using. Avoid drinking alcohol prior to your surgery, and if you smoke, stopping a few days before your surgery can greatly reduce the risk of breathing problems during your surgery.\n\nBe sure to follow your provider's instructions for taking the following: aspirin, vitamin E, multivitamins, herbal remedies, other dietary supplements, and NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen (Advil\u00ae and Motrin\u00ae) and naproxen (Aleve\u00ae).\n\nStop eating at midnight (12 a.m.) the night before your surgery. This includes hard candy and gum.If your healthcare provider told you to stop eating earlier than midnight, follow their instructions. Some people need to fast (not eat) for longer before their surgery.",

        "Day Before Surgery": "Note the time of your surgery and where to go\n\nFollow your provider's instructions for eating prior to surgery - typically you should stop eating at midnight (12 am) the night before your surgery, and this includes hard candy and gum.\n\nWhat to bring:\nYour breathing device for sleep apnea (such as your CPAP machine), if you have one.\nYour incentive spirometer, if you have one.\nAny forms/documents you may need depending on your hospital\nYour cell phone and charger.\nA case for your personal items, if you have any.

Avoid eating or drinking anything not included on this list. Stop drinking entirely 2 hours before your arrival time.\nWater.\nClear apple juice, clear grape juice, or clear cranberry juice.\nGatorade or Powerade.\nBlack coffee or plain tea. It\u2019s OK to add sugar. Do not add anything else.\nDo not add any amount of any type of milk or creamer. This includes plant-based milks and creamers.\nDo not add honey.\nDo not add flavored syrup.\n\nIf you have diabetes, please be mindful of the sugar content in these drinks. To help manage your blood sugar levels, consider choosing sugar-free, low-sugar, or no-added-sugar options.\n\nStaying hydrated before surgery is important, so feel free to drink if you\u2019re thirsty. However, avoid drinking more than necessary, as you will receive intravenous (IV) fluids during your procedure.\n\nTake your medicines as instructed.\n\nShower and wash your hair with baby shampoo the morning of your surgery. Do not use conditioner or hair products such as hair spray or hair gel. Do not put on any lotion, cream, deodorant, makeup, powder, perfume, or cologne after your shower.\n\nChoose comfortable, loose-fitting clothing for the day of your surgery.\n\nIf you normally wear contact lenses, please opt for glasses instead, as wearing contacts during surgery can harm your eyes.\n\nAvoid wearing any metal objects and remove all jewelry, including body piercings.\n\nWhen it\u2019s time for your surgery, you will need to remove items such as eyeglasses, hearing aids, dentures, prosthetic devices, wigs, and religious articles. You will either walk into the operating room or be transported there on a stretcher by a staff member. Once there, a member of the operating room team will assist you onto the operating bed and place compression boots on your lower legs. These boots gently inflate and deflate to promote healthy blood flow in your legs. After you\u2019re settled, your anesthesiologist will administer anesthesia through your IV line, allowing you to fall asleep. You will also receive fluids through your IV during and after the procedure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "Post Surgery - Day After": "After your surgery, you'll wake up within a few minutes to a few hours, and a nurse will keep track of your temperature, pulse, blood pressure, and oxygen levels. You may get oxygen through a tube resting below your nose and mouth, pain medicine, and compression boots on your lower legs. You may be in your hospital's post-anesthesia care unit for a few hours or overnight. Most people stay in the hospital for 1-2 days.",
        "Post Surgery - Day of Discharge": "You may experience mild headaches or discomfort after your surgery. Be sure to talk to your provider about any symptoms you may be experiencing, and you'll get a prescription for pain medicine before you leave the hospital. Talk with your healthcare provider about any concerns you may have.",
