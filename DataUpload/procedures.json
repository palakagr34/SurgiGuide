        "Surgeon's Action": "The procedure will be about an hour long. The surgeon creates a small tube, called a shunt, that connects the brain to blood vessels in the neck or heart to drain excess fluid.

Once there, a member of the operating room team will assist you onto the operating bed and place compression boots on your lower legs. These boots gently inflate and deflate to promote healthy blood flow in your legs. After you\u2019re settled, your anesthesiologist will administer anesthesia through your IV line, allowing you to fall asleep. You will also receive fluids through your IV during and after the procedure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
