The surgeon creates a small tube, called a shunt, that connects the brain to blood vessels in the neck or heart to drain excess fluid. This procedure is done to treat conditions like hydrocephalus, where fluid builds up in the brain and causes swelling. The surgeon may use a tiny camera, called an endoscope, to help guide the procedure.","Make sure to inform your healthcare providers about all the medications and supplements you're using. Avoid drinking alcohol prior to your surgery, and if you smoke, stopping a few days before your surgery can greatly reduce the risk of breathing problems during your surgery.

Be sure to follow your provider's instructions for taking the following: aspirin, vitamin E, multivitamins, herbal remedies, other dietary supplements, and NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen (Advil® and Motrin®) and naproxen (Aleve®).

If you have diabetes, please be mindful of the sugar content in these drinks. To help manage your blood sugar levels, consider choosing sugar-free, low-sugar, or no-added-sugar options.

Staying hydrated before surgery is important, so feel free to drink if you’re thirsty. However, avoid drinking more than necessary, as you will receive intravenous (IV) fluids during your procedure.

Take your medicines as instructed.

Shower and wash your hair with baby shampoo the morning of your surgery. Do not use conditioner or hair products such as hair spray or hair gel. Do not put on any lotion, cream, deodorant, makeup, powder, perfume, or cologne after your shower.

Choose comfortable, loose-fitting clothing for the day of your surgery.

If you normally wear contact lenses, please opt for glasses instead, as wearing contacts during surgery can harm your eyes.

Avoid wearing any metal objects and remove all jewelry, including body piercings.

When it’s time for your surgery, you will need to remove items such as eyeglasses, hearing aids, dentures, prosthetic devices, wigs, and religious articles. You will either walk into the operating room or be transported there on a stretcher by a staff member. Once there, a member of the operating room team will assist you onto the operating bed and place compression boots on your lower legs. These boots gently inflate and deflate to promote healthy blood flow in your legs. After you’re settled, your anesthesiologist will administer anesthesia through your IV line, allowing you to fall asleep. You will also receive fluids through your IV during and after the procedure.







","After your surgery, you'll wake up within a few minutes to a few hours, and a nurse will keep track of your temperature, pulse, blood pressure, and oxygen levels. You may get oxygen through a tube resting below your nose and mouth, pain medicine, and compression boots on your lower legs. You may be in your hospital's post-anesthesia care unit for a few hours or overnight. Most people stay in the hospital for 1-2 days.","You may experience mild headaches or discomfort after your surgery. Be sure to talk to your provider about any symptoms you may be experiencing, and you'll get a prescription for pain medicine before you leave the hospital.
